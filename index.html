   <div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Thankyou for being such a great principle and always letting me get away with everything cause I was your favourite student! Hope life treats you well </p><span>Stefan Pagonis</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Mr Egeberg, you brilliant man! Thanks so much for challenging me to stay at Melbourne High School. You absolutely changed my life.</p><span>Ethan Vogel</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Thanks for showing me what a morally intuitive individually can do for a school and community, in such a short period of time!
Much love Egeberg, I hope life for you will be as humble and inspiring as everyone who had the privilege of being under your wing.  </p><span>Sam Wrathall</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>It will never be the same without you sir, thank you for making our high school life interesting and memorable, I wish you the very best in the future.  </p><span>Zaniel</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Your principal, suits and ties, saturday detentions and year eight maths, drives you home from debating and blasts Madonna the whole way. Thanks you so much Mr. Egeburg.</p><span>Raka</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>I'm so glad that although your time at Thornbury has come to an end, you have left all of us with such great memories, whether it be as a principal, or as my Year 9 maths/form teacher (you were a fab teacher, I was just awful at maths!) thank you for making my time at Thornbury enjoyable, you will definitely be missed! Good luck for the future :) </p><span>Kate Tiliacos</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Sir, you've been the best Principal a student could have asked for, whether it's a two second conversation in the hallway or in a Saturday detention you've always conveyed a care for the students and a passion for the job, thanks for being my Principal for the majority of my high school education!</p><span>Tim Barlow</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Egeberg, being the only High School principal I've ever known, my pool of candidates from which I could draw comparison probably isn't the richest. HOWEVER, you remain to this day one of the most warm hearted, caring, and genuine educators I have had the luck of coming across. I'm sure many kids, and now-adults owe so much of their success and happiness to your uncanny ability to bring the best out in students, and even teachers alike.

I hope your retirement brings you a much deserved break from the years of hard work you've put into thousands of individual students, teachers, and the school. </p><span>Sam Barlow</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Hey you are one awesome principle thats why I built this site</p><span>Scott Nimos</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Dear Perer Egeberg,
You wouldn't know me very well and nor do i know you personally very well; a congratulations for being mine and many others principal for their senior schooling life. You put your life into Thornbury High School and transformed it from an uninviting school into a giant family. I only have good memories of Thornbury because of you and what you've done for the school and can only hope for a well earned retirement for a great person.
So thank you Peter for making mine and many others time at Thornbury High a delightful one.</p><span>James Paladino - Class of 2014</span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>To the greatest principal Thornbury has had, I wouldn't have loved my high school years if it weren't for you, so thank you.</p><span>Mariam Haliem </span></div><div class="grid__col--1-of-2 grid__col inc-margin"><p>Dear Mr egeberg,  It's been a pleasure having you has my principle throughout my schooling at thornbury.

I will forever cherish the memories I've made at THS and cannot thank you enough for your support, encouragement and care for all the students who were lucky enough to see you lead Thornbury to where it is today!

Never before have I experienced a Principal touring with my school band - as you did to save the place, now "all those years ago". Glad it worked! Thank you for your support to the Instrumental program over that time. Bet you'll miss cajoling one of us into giving the spiel during the tour for you (not). Wishing you health and happiness in your retirement.

Peter, you have been a wonderful leader - the very best of leaders - we appreciate your dedication and inspiration, your great sense of fairness to all, your strength and courage of your convictions, your willingness to "get your own hands dirty", your genuine pride and delight in others' achievements, and your energy to strive for continued success for the school, its staff and its students.  History will show that you have left an indelible mark, not only on Thornbury High School but on the lives of students who attended during your time as Principal. Our warmest thanks for all you've done for Tom and Sam.  We wish you a happy retirement!
